```
In my distress i called to the
Lord,
And he answered me.
From the depths of the grave i
called for help,
And you listened to my cry.
I have been banished from your
sight;
Yet i will look again toward
your holy temple.
You hurled me into the deep,
Into the very heart of the seas,
And the currents swirled about
me;
All your waves and breakers
swept over me.
I have been banished from your
sight;
Yet i will look again toward
your holy temple.
I have been banished from your
sight
(yet i will look toward your
holy temple)
I have been banished from your
sight
(yet i will look toward your
holy temple)
